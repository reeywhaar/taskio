// A link that sets a new password without knowing the old one.
//
// Not the recovery address, which is user_recovery from the initial schema. That is where a
// link can be sent; this is the link.
//
// The same shape as invites and for the same reasons: the token is a bearer credential, so
// only its hash is kept and a lost link is reissued rather than recovered; and the row survives
// being spent, because "when was this account last recovered, and who asked" is the question
// somebody looking into a takeover has to be able to answer.
//
// created_by is the administrator who issued it, and NULL when nobody did — a link asked for at
// the login form has no author but whoever can read the mailbox. SET NULL rather than CASCADE,
// so removing an administrator does not erase the record of what they handed out.
//
// Nothing here is unique per principal. Issuing a link neither cancels the last one nor touches
// the password somebody still knows: it is an extra door, not a new lock. Spending one does
// close the others, and voided_at is where that is written down — a link still outstanding when
// a different one was used cannot, from that moment, be told apart from a stolen one.
