events tells a browser that something changed, so it can ask what.

Server-sent events rather than a websocket: what travels is one word in one direction, the
browser's EventSource reconnects on its own with backoff, and it is plain HTTP — no upgrade to
negotiate, no dependency, and nothing in front of it has to be taught a second protocol.

The message carries nothing. What changed is a question the caller already has endpoints for,
and a payload here would be a second copy of the model to keep true.
