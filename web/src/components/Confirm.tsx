 * window.confirm is drawn by the browser: its fonts, buttons labelled OK and Cancel, the page's
 * address for a title, and one sentence with no room to say which button does what. This keeps
 * its shape — ask, and await a yes or a no — so a call site reads as it did, and names the
 * button for what it does.
 *
 * Neither button takes focus. The dialog holds it, as every dialog here does where no field asks
 * for it: a ring on the button that deletes reads as armed, and Enter should not be the way
 * something is destroyed. Escape and the close are a no.
 *
 * One dialog for the island, mounted by the provider, rather than one per button that asks.
