/**
 * Keeps one broken piece from taking the page with it.
 *
 * A class, because catching a render is the one thing hooks cannot do. What it shows is short
 * and names where the trouble is rather than what it was: the message React hands over is a
 * stack trace's first line, which tells somebody reading a settings page nothing they can act
 * on. The console keeps the rest.
 *
 * Trying again is worth offering because most of what breaks a render here is data that was
 * not what it claimed, and the next answer may be. It only clears the flag — anything that
 * fails the same way twice says so again rather than looping.
